# Teach-a-Quadcopter-How-to-Fly

"This project was submitted as part of the Deep Learning nanodegree on Udacity"

In this project, you will design an agent that can fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice! Try to apply the techniques you have learnt in this module to find out what works best, but also feel free to come up with innovative ideas and test them.
